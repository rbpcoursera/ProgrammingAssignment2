## Provides the facilities for constructing a matrix that caches its inverse
## as well as invalidating the inverse once the matrix changes

## Constructs a wrapper around a matrix which caches it's inverse

{

    # Personally, I think that cacheSolve should be defined here locally
    # but not be put into the function list. Instead, when getInverse is
    # invoked, it should invoke cacheSolve (which would access local data
    # directly rather than using the functions)

## Return the inverse of the wrapped matrix defined above
## Returns either the cached result of the last invocation, or it will compute
## the inverse and cache it for future access (until the matrix changes)
